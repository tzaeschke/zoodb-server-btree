//	 * they can be referenced from persistent classes and can be stored and restored without
//	 * having to be a persistent class themselves.
//	 * 
//	 * However, for example instances of class {@code File} are by default not allowed and will 
//	 * cause an exception (instances of {@code File} are also not recommended to be stored).

	 * In a properly enhanced/activated class, the difference should no be noticeable, because

	 * y default, as specified in JDO 3.1, closed queries and extents behave as if they were
	 * empty.
	 * 
	 * ZooDB allows to change this behavior such that access to closed Queries and Extents
	 * cause an Exception to be thrown. This may be desirable because it can indicate
	 * erroneous access to invalidated queries and extents, suggesting that they
	 * were fully traversed, rather than indicating that the result appears only empty because
	 * it is accessed at the wrong time.
