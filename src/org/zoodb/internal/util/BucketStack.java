/**
 * Bucket array list without random access. This is best used as stack.
 * 
 * See PerfIterator for performance considerations.
 * 
 * Works like an ArrayList but is much faster when getting big, because the bucket architecture
 * avoids copying the existing list to a new array as happens in the ArrayList.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Fast adding, removing and traversal.
 * - Speed of all operations (except clear()) independent of size.
 *  
 * Limitations:
 * - Only the last element can be removed!
 * - Elements can only be added to the end.

	 * Concurrency: 
	 * - If clear() and remove() are not used, concurrency is simple, we just remember the current 
	 *   max and iterator to it. This is effectively a COW iterator. If clear() and remove() are
	 *   used, we would have to make sure that the references are not deleted. For example:
	 *   remove() keeps references; only clear() removes the whole tree (replace by new empty 
	 *   bucket); but the iterator could keep a reference to the tree as long as required.
	 * - We could make the iterator adaptive, so it only iterates to the end of the current list.
	 *   This works nicely with clear() and remove(), but results in a somewhat unusual concurrency
	 *   policy.
	 * TODO choose and implement.
	 * 
	 *  TODO
	 *  Other improvement: may it be faster to store a stack here and keep a reference to the 
	 *  current bucket? Iteration should be faster for large pages, but Iterator creation is slower.
	 *  But for large pages, using get to find them should be fast as well.
