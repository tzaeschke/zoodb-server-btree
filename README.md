News
====

2017-07-18 - Release of ZooDB 0.5.0. New features:
 * Java 8
 * JDO 3.1
 * Migrated logging to slf4j
 * Various bugs fixed 


Bug Bounty #2
=============
Starting March 3rd 2017, until May 31st 2017, there is a bug bounty for severe bugs concerning indexing and database consistency. Five bugs were accepted for the bug bounty.


Bug Bounty
==========
The first bug hunt started June 11 2016 and ended June 30 2016. The hunt was for severe bugs concerning indexing and database consistency. No bugs were reported.


Current Status
==============
Under development, but already in use by some university projects.


Current Features
================
- Works as normal database or as in-memory database.
- Fast (4x faster than db4o using db4o's PolePosition benchmark suite).
- Reasonably scalable, has been used successfully with 60,000,000+ objects in a 30+ GB database.
- Maximum object count: 2^63.
- Maximum database size depends on (configurable) cluster size: 2^31 * CLUSTER_SIZE. With default cluster size: 2^31 * 4KB = 8TB.
- Crash-recovery/immunity (dual flush, no log-file required).
- Standard stuff: commit/rollback, query, indexing, lazy-loading, transitive persistence & updates (persistence by reachability), automatic schema definition, embedded object support (second class objects).
- Queries support standard operators, indexing, path queries, parameters, aggregation (avg, max, min), projection, uniqueness, ORDER BY, setting result classes (partial), methods (partial).
- Multi-user/-session capability (optimistic TX), but currently not terribly efficient.
- Thread-safe.
- XML export/import (currently only binary attributes).
- Some examples are available in the 'examples' folder.
- Open source (GPLv3).

Note that some features may be available in the latest snapshot only.

Current Limitations
===================
- Schema evolution is ~90% complete (updating OIDs is not properly supported, no low level queries).
  --> Queries don't work with lazy evolution.
- No backup (except copying the DB file).
- Single process usage only (No stand-alone server).
- JDO only partially supported:
  - Some query features not supported: group by, range, variables, imports, setting result classes (partial).
  - No XML config or Annotations; configuration only via Java API.
  - Manual enhancement of classes required (insert activateRead()/activateWrite() & extend provided super-class).
- Little documentation (some example code), but follows JDO 3.0 spec.
